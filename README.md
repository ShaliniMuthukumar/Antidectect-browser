# Antidectect-browser

Conceptualised, designed, and developed a Browser, an innovative anti-detect browser
tailored specifically for web scraping purposes. Engineered a sophisticated fingerprintswitching mechanism capable of seamlessly rotating over 80,000 unique fingerprints,
effectively masking scraping activities and evading detection. Implemented advanced
browser behaviours and user agent rotation strategies to simulate human-like browsing
patterns, ensuring high success rates in scraping operations. Conducted extensive testing and
optimisation to maximise effectiveness and reliability, resulting in a highly efficient tool for
scraping data from diverse websites. Received positive feedback from users and industry
experts for the browser's effectiveness in overcoming anti-scraping measures and enhancing
data collection capabilities.
